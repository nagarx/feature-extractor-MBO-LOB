# NVDA Multi-Horizon Dataset Configuration (Schema 2.1)
# 
# Multi-horizon export for analyzing signal decay across prediction horizons.
# Useful for:
#   - Understanding which signals are predictive at short vs long horizons
#   - Comparing signal strength decay characteristics
#   - Selecting optimal horizons for different trading strategies
#   - Benchmarking against FI-2010 and DeepLOB papers
#
# PREREQUISITE: Decompress all files to hot store first:
#   cd MBO-LOB-reconstructor
#   cargo run --release --bin decompress_to_hot_store -- \
#       --input ../data/NVDA_2025-02-01_to_2025-09-30 \
#       --output ../data/hot_store
#
# Usage:
#   cd feature-extractor-MBO-LOB
#   cargo run --release --features parallel --bin export_dataset -- --config configs/nvda_multi_horizon.toml
